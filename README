Purpose
=======

 - A tool that help my exercise

**Scenario**

I need some exercise. So I plan following exercises for a day during a
month.
 - running 360 minute
 - 1000 count pushups

I use my spare times. 10 minutes running, 30 count pushups, 40 count, 20
minutes running ... My goal is to fill 360 minutes and 1000 counts pushups
totally on a day.

eManual helps scheduling and recording. Schedule and record the counts
with eManual. After a month I can see my weakness.


Requirements
============

 - scons
 - qt4
 - boost
 - fullcalendar 1.5.3 (included)
 - qdjango (included)
 - qjson (included)


Compiling
=========

In Fedora
$ sudo yum install qt qt-devel boost boost-* scons
$ cd PATH_THE_DIRECTORY
$ sed 's/\#if 1/\#if 0/g' src/main.cpp		#test mode --> build mode
$ scons
$ build/Test					#execute


Using
=====

1. You need "element". Push mouse right button to create "element", then
click "Create Element". To schedule your exercise insert Name, Unit and
Purpose. Shortcut and Note is optional. Shortcut is used when you simply
add the record.

You can create "group" with list of "element"s.

2. Drag calendar with mouse left button. You can schedule "element" or
"group" with the calendar.


TODO
====

To archive this tool I have to do following
 - View of current status
 - Report results
 - Simple user interface

These days I don't interest this tool. It means that there is no
additional codes. But I will coding if someone want to use this tool.
